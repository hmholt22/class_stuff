    "# A brief introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello! in this tutorial, you'll learn some basic Python functionality. We'll mainly learn by doing around here, so if you feel like you don't know something yet, no worries. We'll get there!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we're using jupyter notebooks as our first tool. If you'd prefer an IDE, PyCharm is recommended. Jupyter Notebooks use what's called \"markdown\" code. Instead of running line-by-line, Jupyter Notebooks run code chunk-by-chunk. That is whenever you select a cell and hit \"run\" you're only running that cell! It does store the data as long as the notebook is active, so you can continue working on things cell-by-cell. It's a really good way of testing code and getting used to coding in small chunks before you start writing much larger programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code chunks and kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Python keeps memory of any data and operations you've run in the notebook via a kernel. When you start the notebook, your kernel will automatically start and you can begin coding. A kernel is basically another programming language that lives inside Python and has control over everything - keeping memory, allocating new memory, running operations, managing output, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you want the kernel to run a certain cell, you can highlight the cell you want and hit the \"play\" button you see above where it says \"Run\". This will run the current cell and then move to the next one, but it will wait to run that one until you tell it to. The keyboard shortcut for this is ctrl+enter if you want to run the cell alone, and shift+enter if you want to run the cell and move to the following cell. Try it below!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes your kernel will run into problems and take a long time to compute something. If you ever want to stop your kernel in the midst of a long computation, use the stop symbol. If you wish to restart your kernel, use the circular arrow button. And finally, if you want to reset the kernel and run every cell in the notebook - hit the fast-forward button. You can also see buttons to cut, copy and paste cells, move them up or down in order, add new blank cells and save your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means it bascially functions by creating things called \"objects\" which the programmer can design and attach attributes and methods to in order to apply to certain problems. We'll go over how to create objects later in the course. For the already-initiated, Python a very similar language to C++ or Java, though some of the syntax is different (And it's also much slower!). We use Python however because of its enormous flexibility in handling data, ease of scripting, and the active development community producing new packages to deal with common problems, which we don't have with other coding languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "For now we only need to know at a very high level what functions are. Functions simply take input and transform it in a certain way to produce output. There are several built-in functions that Python already has. One such function is the `print()` function. The input(s) for a function are called \"arguments\" and they are put inside the parentheses of the function. If the function is designed to produce visual output, it will be displayed in the output window or in your terminal if you use a command line interface. You will know if you're calling a base python function because it will always show up colored green.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My first Python program\n",
    "\n",
    "All coders learn the same program to begin their careers, called the \"Hello world!\" program. Here we simply want to print the phrase \"Hello world!\" and display it as output. In this case, we can simply print the phrase \"Hello world!\""

    "## Data types \n",
    "\n",
    "Python, like all programming languages, uses data types to refer to certain objects it may encounter. It is important to get these data types correct because you can do certain operations with some data types that won't work with others. Some basic data types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `string` - This is text data and will allow for numbers and special characters. Strings are declared with the use of single (') or double (\") quotes. \n",
    "- `int` - integer data\n",
    "- `float` - floating point data (i.e. numbers with decimals)\n",
    "- `bool` - a special data type which can only take on the values true or false\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more and more complicated data types, but we'll get to those as we go on in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables and assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed, it's really inefficient to just carry around values of objects in our code all the time, so we frequently want to assign values to variables, so we can just call those instead of the actual content. \n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring variables is done with the assignment operator `=`. Notice that \"equals\" is not a logical statement like in mathematics. It is a way to tell Python that a variable needs to take on a specific value. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance. Suppose I wanted to store the string \"Hello world!\" to a variable `x` so I don't have to type out \"Hello world!\" all the time. That is done with the assignment operator like so:"
